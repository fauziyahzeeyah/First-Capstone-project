                The Nigeria Music Concert NMC is a live music performance in front of an audience. The performance may be by a single musician,
                              sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble.
                This year's NMC is a different one because unlike every other NMC it's done in June which is the middle of the year and it's 
                              gonna be fun. So do yourself a big favor to forget sorrow.
                Don't forget that it's not meant for Nigerians alone, friends from overseas and other country are welcome to be happy, so don't 
                              let them miss that special and happy moment of their lives. 
                              This is taking place in Nigeria, get your tickets ready so 
                              you don't miss the front row. Stay tuned.

        <h3>Nigeria Music Concert NMC 2023 Logo</h3>
        <p>
            <pre style="color: black; margin-left: 120px;">
                The NMC logo was originated from its first letters of its title Nigeria Music Concert
                It was styled NMC in January 2023 and now called NMC instead of its original title.
                Here is how its styled, though simple but easy to say.
